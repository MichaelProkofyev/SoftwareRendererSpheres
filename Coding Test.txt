C# Programming Test: Managed Sphere Data Viewer

We provide two files (sphere_sample_points.txt and sphere_sample_points.xml) with the sphere data.
Each sphere in the dataset is defined by position, radius and colour. In order to visualize a 3d 
sphere dataset in real-time, a CPU only solution should be implemented. 

Your Task: A Viewer that meets following requirements:
• The image should be rendered to a 1024x1024@32bit buffer.
• The spheres should spin in front of the camera. 
• the dataset is static
• The dataset should be read from the included XML file (sphere_sample_points.xml).
• Each sphere should gradually change between its initial and a random color while rotating.
	- They need to change 10 times per full rotation.
• The spheres should be rendered:
	- Using perspective projection.
	- Using some HSR (Hidden Surface Removal) algorithm.
• Simple shading (diffuse and specular) from a directional light source. No need for shadows.

A framework with the initial implementation is provided with the test. 

The viewer should be created on top of that framework following those guidelines:
• Add the missing viewer functionality.
• Aim for a performance as well as appropriately structured code.
	- Implement the system with the necessary data structures.
	- Make sure that the dataset is rendered efficiently. 
	- Use multiple threads (don’t worry about portability or backward compatibility).
	- Inner loop performance optimization.
	- Libraries such as System.Numerics can be used.
	- Nice visual output is a plus.
• Ensure stable results when the elements touch the view borders.
• Explain why you made certain design decisions.
• Write clean and readable code.
• Comment the code to the degree that you feel is necessary.

Expected environment: OS=Windows, CPU=Intel Core i7 or AMD RYZEN 7, RAM=16GB

Please send back the modifed source code within 1 week.
